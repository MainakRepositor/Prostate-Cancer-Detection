### Problem : 

Heart Attack is a chronic health condition that affects how your heart pumps blood throughout your body. It is not a disease but a phenomena, where there are sudden cardiac arrests. Having healthy, low-cholesterol food, and being active can really help in reducing the chances of cardiac arrest. 

### Solution:

This Web app will help you to predict whether a person has chances of cardiac arrest or is prone to get it in future by analysing the values of several features using the Decision Tree Classifier.

### Idea: 
Building an application that can predict the occurrence of a cardiac arrest or the possible causes of it by indicating the highly relevant factors.
